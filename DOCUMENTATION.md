## Model
1. Payment.class: In this class, the entity model is created to connect to the database. 
Jakarta and Lombok annotations are used to make the code easier to write. 
``@Entity`` to mark the class as a JPA entity. ``@Getter`` ``@Setter`` to create them. 
``@AllArgsConstructor`` ``@NoArgsConstructor`` creates constructor and creates empty. 
``@NotNull`` to specify that the attribute can be empty. ``@Table(name = "")`` is used to mark the table that will be used as the entity for this class. 
And in each tribute a column ``@Column(name = "")`` is assigned to it. ``@Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)`` 
was also used to mark a mapping for multiple values â€‹â€‹and they are saved as a string in the database.
2. PaymentCurrency.class: In this class the class that maps the currency values is created to have a better dependency injection.

## DTO
1. PaymentDto.class: In this class we abstract three variables that would be amount, currency and description, we add ``@Getter`` and ``@Setter`` annotations. In currency we create the object from the created class ``PaymentCurrency.class``.
2. PaymentDto2.class: In this class we abstract the attributes of the ``Payment.class class``, we add the ``@Setter`` and ``@Getter`` to them. We also create the ``fromString`` method with a string parameter, it converts a value to a string and return the value in string.

## Mapper
1. PaymentMapper.class: In this class we create 2 methods to map to the ``PaymentDto2.class`` dto and to the ``Payment.class`` class.
  - ``public static PaymentDto2 toDto()`` This method creates an object of class ``PaymentDto2.class`` and inside it sets the value that is in ``Payment.class`` example
  ``paymentDto.setIdPayments(payment.getIdPayments());``
  - ``public static Payment toModel()`` This method creates an object of class ``Payment.class`` and inside it sets the value that is in ``PaymentDto2.class`` example
 ``payment.setDescription(paymentDto.getDescription());``
 
 ## Repository
 1. PaymentRepository.interface: In this interface, the ``@Repository`` annotation is used to detect that it will fulfill that function. It extends from JPA, within the parameters it is connected to the Payment class/entity, and the function of searching through a string for the stripe id was created.

## Service
1. IPaymentService.interface: This interface is for best practice, and is to be instantiated, springboot will know that the service methods will be called. Contains the three PaymentService methods.
2. PaymentService.class: In this class we add the ``@Service`` annotation so that it is identified as such. The ``IPaymentService`` interface is implemented, 
``@Value`` is used to call the variable containing the Stripe API Key, and a new variable is assigned. A service object and a service method are created.
  - PaymentIntent: In this method, the variable that contains the API key Stripe is called. A string array is created to put the types of payment methods, a ``"card"`` is created inside, the passed parameters are mapped, ``"amount"``, ``"currency"``, ``"description"`` and ``"payment_method_types"`` and a token is created. In the same method I create an object of the ``PaymentDto2.class`` class and I set the status, the Date and the Stripe ID, I also set the Amount, Currency and Description, it is mapped and the ``toModel`` method is called and returns a response in json with the token.
  - Confirm: In this method, the variable that contains the API key Stripe is called again, with the ID a request is sent again and the parameters are mapped with a nhashmap of ``"payment_method"`` and ``"pm_card_visa"`` or the payment method assigned to it. Within this, an object of ``PaymentDto2.class`` is created and the method of the repository is called to search for the Stripe ID by string, and the payment status is updated, and the day is saved in the database. This method returns a json with the token of the successful payment method.
  - Cancelled: In this method, the variable that contains the API key Stripe is called, with the ID of the token the payment is cancelled. A ``PaymentDto2.class`` object is created, instantiated in the repository and the Stripe ID is searched for by string, to update the status to "Cancelled". This method returns a token in json format.
 
 ## Controller 
 1. PaymentController.class: This class uses the annotations ``@RestController`` to identify the class as a REST controller, ``@RequestMapping("/)`` to mark a general url map, and ``@CrossOrigin(origins = "")`` to allow those I designate to access these. endpoints.
``@Autowired`` is used to instantiate a class and create an object from it without the need to create it with new.
``PostMapping`` is used to mark the POST request, they can be POST, PUT, DELETE, GET, in this case it is POST because we will send the request. In the ``@PostMapping("/")`` annotation, the endpoint to make the request is assigned. We have three endpoint.
  - @PostMapping("/paymentintent"): This endpoint sends a request by calling the ``Paymentintent`` method of ``IPaymentService.interface``, receives as a parameter a ``PaymentDto.class`` object that represents the data needed to make the request. Upon receiving the response, it converts it to JSON and returns it.
  - @PostMapping("/confirm/{id}"): This endpoint receives the ID of the PaymentIntent object to confirm. The request is sent, calls the PaymentConfirm method of ``IPaymentService.interface``, the external Stripe library is used. After being committed, the object is converted to JSON and returned as a response using the ``ResponseEntity<String>`` class.
  - @PostMapping("/cancel/{id}"): This endpoint receives the ID of the PaymentIntent object to cancel. The request is sent, calls the PaymentCancel method of ``IPaymentService.interface``, the external Stripe library is used. After being committed, the object is converted to JSON and returned as a response using the ``ResponseEntity<String>`` class.
